Inter0ptik is on the lam and is pinned down. The area is crawling with cops, and so he must stay put.
But he also desperately needs to be able to get a message out to Ann and Mr. X.
Lucky for him he detects a single wireless access point (WAP) in the building next door that he might be able to use,
but it is using encryption and there are no other opportunities available. What is Inter0ptik to do?

Meanwhile, next door…

Joe is a sysadmin at HackMe, Inc. He runs the technical infrastructure for a small company, including a WAP that he uses, pretty much exclusively,
and also very rarely. He’s trying to use it now and has discovered his connection is dropping consistently. He captures some traffic,
but he really has no idea how to interpret it. Suddenly he discovers he can’t even login to administer his WAP at all!

You are the forensic investigator.
Your team got a tip that Inter0ptik might be hunkered down in the area and contacted local admins concerning suspicious network activity.
Joe has provided you with his packet capture and helpfully tells you that his own MAC address is 00:11:22:33:44:55.
Can you figure out what’s going on and track the attacker’s activities?

1) Joe’s WAP is beaconing. Based on the contents of the packet capture,
what are:
a. The SSID of his access point?
b. The BSSID of his access point?

1.	SSID:  Ment0rNet

2.	BSSID: 00:23:69:61:00:d0
         
2) How long is the packet capture, from beginning to end (in SECONDS –
please round to the nearest full second)?
413.576seconds- 414 secs

3) How many WEP-encrypted data frames are there total in the packet capture?
There are 59274 WEP-encrypted data frames in our capture file.

4) How many *unique* WEP initialization vectors (IVs) are there TOTAL in
the packet capture relating to Joe’s access point?
29719 unique WEP IVs during the capture.

5) What was the MAC address of the station executing the Layer 2 attacks?
The mac address of the station making the layer 2 attacks is 1c:4b:d6:69:cd:07. Having 81,535 packets. Found in Statistics->endpoints->IEE 802.11

6) How many *unique* IVs were generated (relating to Joe’s access point):
a. By the attacker station? The answer is 14133.

b. By all *other* stations combined?  The answer is 15587

7) What was the WEP key of Joe’s WAP?
Using aircrack-ng (Helpful in decryption of key)
D0:E5:9E:B9:04.

8) What were the administrative username and password of the targeted
wireless access point?
After applying filter http.authbasic
username: admin  password: admin
9) What was the WAP administrative passphrase changed to?
 PassPhrase=hahp0wnedJ00
